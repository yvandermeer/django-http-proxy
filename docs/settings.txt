Available settings
==================

The Django HTTP Proxy application has only a single *required* setting
(``PROXY_DOMAIN``) and a number of optional settings.

Any settings should be placed in your project's settings module (most commonly
``settings.py``).

PROXY_DOMAIN
------------
Default: Not defined

The domain that the proxy should forward to. Example::

    PROXY_DOMAIN = 'www.google.com'

PROXY_PORT
----------
Default: ``80``

The port that the proxy should forward to on the provided ``PROXY_DOMAIN``. Example::

    PROXY_PORT = 7777

PROXY_USER
----------
Default: Not defined

The username for authentication to the server that requests are forwarded to. Example::

    PROXY_USER = 'yuri'

PROXY_PASSWORD
--------------
Default: Not defined

The password for authentication to the server that requests are forwarded to. Example::

    PROXY_PASSWORD = 'secret'

.. _setting-proxy-mode:

PROXY_MODE
----------
Default: ``None``

The mode that the proxy should run in. Available modes are ``record`` and 
``play``. If no mode is defined (``None`` – the default), this means the proxy
will work as a "standard" HTTP proxy.

If the mode is set to ``record``, all requests will be forwarded to the remote
server, but both the requests and responses will be recorded to the database
for playback at a later stage::
    
    PROXY_MODE = 'record'

If the mode is set to ``play``, *no requests will be forwarded to the remote
server*.::

    PROXY_MODE = 'play'
    
In ``play`` mode, if the response (to the request being made) was previously
recorded, the recorded response will be served. Otherwise, a custom
``Http404`` exception will be raised (``RequestNotRecorded``)

PROXY_IGNORE_UNSUPPORTED
------------------------
Default: ``True``

The recording functionality of the Django HTTP Proxy is currently limited to
plain text content types. The default behavior is to ignore any unsupported
content types when ``PROXY_MODE`` is set to ``record`` – responses with
unsupported content types are not recorded and will be ignored silently. If
you set ``PROXY_IGNORE_UNSUPPORTED`` to ``False``, any unsupported response
types will raise an ``ResponseUnsupported`` exception.
